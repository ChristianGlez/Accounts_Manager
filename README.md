Accounts Manager
================

Accounts Manager: sample application to manage Internet accounts (username, password, etc.) like facebook, twitter and other internet services (N.B. this is a sample app to try new technologies, for this reason security topics are not considered)

It is a sample CRUD web application built up with Twitter Bootstrap, Backbone JS, REST services and J2EE backend.

You can also run an hosted version of the application on my OpenShift server:
